\arguments{
\item{x}{design matrix of predictors}

\item{y}{response variable}

\item{p}{the size of the predictor set}

\item{n}{the size of the number of observations}

\item{candidate}{the current candidate set of predictors to select from}

\item{solution}{the current set of predictors already selected}

\item{model}{the set of predictors to use in the final model}

\item{bic}{the cutoff value for determining the model set}

\item{step}{the step in the iteration currently on}

\item{strong}{indicator of the strength of marginality to be used}

\item{higher_order}{logical TRUE indicating to include order-3 interactions in the search (default FALSE)}

\value{
a summary of the linear model returned after the selection procedure
}
\description{
Extended variable selection approaches to jointly model main and interaction effects from high-dimensional data orignally proposed by Hao and Zhang (2014) and extended by Gosik and Wu (2016).
Based on a greedy forward approach, their model can identify all possible interaction effects through two algorithms, iFORT and iFORM, which have been proved to possess sure screening property in an ultrahigh-dimensional setting.
}
\details{
Runs the iForm selection procedure on the dataset and returns a linear model
of the final selected model.
