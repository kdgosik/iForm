\title{Creating interactions based off of weak heredity principle}
\usage{
weak_order3(S, C, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{vector of solution predictor selected from previous steps of the procedure}

\item{C}{vector of candidate predictors to consider in this step of the procedure}

\item{data}{data.frame of your data with the response and all p predictors}
}
\value{
A vector of the RSS values for each candidate predictor
}
\description{
Helper function to give all possible order-3 interactions following the strong
heredity principle.
}
\details{
Finds all p choose 3 combinations between the predicotrs in the solution set and the
predictors in the candidate set.
